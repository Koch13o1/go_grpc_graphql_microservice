# Scalable Microservices-Based Backend for E-commerce

This repository contains a **massive Golang microservices project** that integrates **GraphQL, gRPC, Docker, PostgreSQL, and Elasticsearch**. The system is designed to be highly scalable, modular, and efficient.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is built using **Golang** and follows a microservices architecture with three core services:
- **Account Service** (PostgreSQL)
- **Product Service** (Elasticsearch)
- **Order Service** (PostgreSQL)

All microservices communicate via **gRPC** and are exposed through a **GraphQL Gateway** for querying and mutations.

---
## 🏗️ Architecture
### What is being Built
The system consists of:
- A **GraphQL Gateway** that serves as the entry point.
- **Account, Product, and Order Clients** that communicate with their respective microservices over **gRPC**.
- **Account, Product, and Order Servers** that process requests and interact with their respective databases.

### Tech Stack
- **Golang** for backend services
- **gRPC** for microservices communication
- **GraphQL** as the API Gateway
- **Docker** for containerization
- **PostgreSQL** for Account and Order storage
- **Elasticsearch** for Product storage

### Docker Containers
Each microservice runs in its own **Docker container**:
- GraphQL Gateway
- Account Service & PostgreSQL Database
- Product Service & Elasticsearch Database
- Order Service & PostgreSQL Database

Docker orchestration is managed using **docker-compose**.

---
## 📜 GraphQL Schema
The GraphQL schema defines queries and mutations for interacting with the system:
### Queries:
- Fetch **Products**
- Fetch **Accounts**
- Fetch **Orders**

### Mutations:
- **CreateAccount**
- **CreateProduct**
- **CreateOrder**

---
## 🛠️ Services
Each microservice exposes the following endpoints:
### Account Service
- `POST /account` - Create a new account
- `GET /account/{id}` - Get a specific account
- `GET /accounts` - Get all accounts

### Product Service
- `POST /product` - Create a new product
- `GET /product/{id}` - Get a specific product
- `GET /products` - Get all products

### Order Service
- `POST /order` - Create a new order
- `GET /orders/{account_id}` - Get orders for a particular account

## 🏃 Running the Project
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Golang]
- [Docker]
- [PostgreSQL]


### Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/golang-microservices-project.git
   cd golang-microservices-project
   ```
2. Start all services using Docker Compose:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
3. Access the GraphQL Playground at:
   ```
   http://localhost:4000
   ```
